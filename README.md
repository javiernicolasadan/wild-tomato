## Description

"Wild Tomato" is a simple game where the player controls a tomato plant that must move up and down to avoid collisions with scissors that approach from the right border of the screen. The score increase over time, so the longer the player avoids collisions, the higher the score. 
The game ends when the player collisions with a scissor.
